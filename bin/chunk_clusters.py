"""
Splits MMSeqs2 cluster output into numbered chunks. Clusters smaller than --threshold
are discarded either way; --out_format decides what a chunk is:

  fasta: one FASTA file per surviving cluster, the input to per-family alignment.
  tsv:   one headerless representative<TAB>member TSV per --clusters_per_chunk
         clusters, the input to iterative family generation, which builds many
         families per task and reads sequences from the full FASTA itself.

    """
    Read an MMSeqs2 TSV (col 0 = representative, col 1 = member) and return clusters at or
    above the size threshold. The representative is counted as a member of its own cluster,
    so a singleton cluster has size 1.

    MMSeqs2 does not guarantee the row order of its TSV, so clusters are sorted by
    representative ID and members by ID, with the representative kept first. Chunk
    numbers, and with them family names, are then identical across runs, as is the member
    order every aligner sees. Only clusters that pass the threshold are sorted, and members
    in place, so the sort costs a small fraction of parsing the TSV.

    Args:
        clustering_file (str): MMSeqs2 clustering TSV file.
        threshold (int): Minimum cluster size to retain.
