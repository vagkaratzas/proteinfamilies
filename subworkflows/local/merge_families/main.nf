/*
    FAMILY MERGING

    Groups similar families into pools, merges their seed MSAs into a single combined
    seed, then rebuilds final family models via GENERATE_FAMILIES. The merged_id
    encodes which original families were combined (e.g., 'sample_1_7' from 'sample_1'
    and 'sample_7'); for very large pools it collapses to a stable hash so the
    resulting output filename stays within the filesystem's name-length limit.
