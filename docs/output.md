# nf-core/proteinfamilies: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

Quality check:

- [SeqFu](#seqfu) for input amino acid sequences quality check (QC)
- [SeqKit](#seqkit) for preprocessing input amino acid sequences (i.e., gap removal, convert to upper case, validate, filter by length, replace special characters such as `/`, and remove duplicate sequences)

Initial clustering:

- [MMseqs2](#mmseqs2) initial clustering of input amino acid sequences and filtering with membership threshold

Multiple sequence alignment:

- [FAMSA](#famsa) aligner option. Best speed and sensitivity option to build seed multiple sequence alignment for the families
- [mafft](#mafft) aligner option. Fast but not as sensitive as FAMSA to build seed multiple sequence alignment for the families
- [ClipKIT](#clipkit) to optionally clip gapped portions of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA)

Generating family models:

- [hmmer](#hmmer) to build the family HMM (hmmbuild) and to optionally 'fish' additional sequences from the input fasta file (hmmsearch), with given thresholds, into the family and also build the family full MSA (hmmalign)
- [mgnifam](#mgnifam) alternative to the alignment and model building steps above, selected with `--family_generation_algorithm iterative`. It repeats HMM building, sequence recruitment and realignment per cluster up to three rounds, or until each family converges or is discarded

Removing redundancy:

- [hmmer](#hmmer-for-redundancy-removal) to match family representative sequences against other family models in order to keep non redundant and/or merge similar ones
- [MMseqs2](#mmseqs2-for-redundancy-removal) to strictly cluster the sequences within each of the remaining families, in order to still capture the evolutionary diversity within a family, but without keeping all the almost identical sequences
- [FAMSA](#famsa-for-redundancy-removal) aligner option. Re-align full MSA with final set of sequences
- [mafft](#mafft-for-redundancy-removal) aligner option. Re-align full MSA with final set of sequences
- [HH-suite3](#hh-suite3) to reformat raw full `.sto` MSAs to `.fas`, in case the user did not select to remove in-family sequence redundancy, that automatically re-aligns sequences with either FAMSA or mafft

Updating families:

- [untar](#untar) to decompress tarballs of existing hmms and msas
- [hmmer](#hmmer-for-updating-families) to match input sequences to existing families with hmmsearch as well as for rebuilding models with newly recruited sequences with hmmbuild
- [SeqKit](#seqkit-for-updating-families) to extract fasta formatted family sequences from their MSA files
- [MMseqs2](#mmseqs2-for-updating-families) to strictly cluster the sequences within each of the families to update
- [FAMSA](#famsa-for-updating-families) aligner option. Re-align full MSA with final set of sequences
- [mafft](#mafft-for-updating-families) aligner option. Re-align full MSA with final set of sequences
- [ClipKIT](#clipkit-for-updating-families) to optionally clip gapped portions of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA)

Phylogenetic tree inference:

- [CMAPLE](#cmaple) - Reconstruct phylogenetic trees from family member sequences

Reporting:

- [Extract family representatives](#extract-family-representatives) to produce the final metadata file along with a fasta of all family representative sequences (can be used downstream for structural prediction).
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

Downstream pipelines:

- [nf-core/proteinfold](#nf-coreproteinfold) downstream samplesheet generation from final family representative sequences
- [nf-core/proteinannotator](#nf-coreproteinannotator) downstream samplesheet generation from final family representative sequences

The optionally saved `chunked_fasta` folder contains these fasta files of sequences for each cluster.
These per cluster fasta files act as input to produce downstream families in the next steps of the pipeline.
The original mmseqs db and the clustered mmseqs db can be optional saved to the output folder, but they won't be further utilised in this pipeline.

</details>

The `hmm/raw` folder contains all originally created family HMMs, under a subfolder named after the tool that built them
(`hmmer_hmmbuild/` for the standard algorithm, `mgnifam/` for the iterative one), as with the seed and full MSA outputs. These models will be used downstream to recruit additional sequences in families, to compute
full MSAs if `--skip_additional_sequence_recruiting` is set to `false`, and/or to remove among-family redundancies if `--skip_family_redundancy_removal` is set to `false`.
When `--skip_family_redundancy_removal` is set to `false`, the `hmm/filtered` folder will also be produced with the filtered subset of the original raw HMMs.
The `hmm/library` will contain a compiled and gzipped single HMM library file per sample.
The HMMs (raw or filtered) can also be used in the `update_families` execution mode of the pipeline,
along with the families' respective full MSAs, to recruit sequences from a new input fasta file into the families, updating both family HMM and full MSA files.

[hmmer](https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer) is a fast and flexible alignment trimming tool that keeps phylogenetically informative sites and removes others.

### mgnifam

    - `hmm/raw/mgnifam/`, `full_msa/raw/mgnifam/`, `generate_families_iteratively/`: the same outputs for the families rebuilt after merging

All files under `generate_families_iteratively/` require `--save_iterative_family_metadata`.

</details>

Each file is named after the chunk of clusters it came from and the family's position within it, so `<samplename>_2_5` is the fifth family of the sample's second chunk.

The discarded records are the main way to tell why a cluster produced no family: mgnifam drops clusters whose representative falls outside the length bounds, or whose starting membership does not survive recruitment.

The converged records indicate which of the families optimized their model within three iterations.

[mgnifam](https://github.com/vagkaratzas/mgnifam) iteratively builds protein family HMM profiles from sequence clusters and expands them against a protein database, using pyfamsa, pytrimal and pyhmmer internally.

</details>

If one of `--skip_family_redundancy_removal` or `--skip_family_merging` is set to `false`, the `hmmer/hmmsearch` module is used
to identify family representative sequences that are identical or similar (respectively) to other family HMMs.
In case of redundancy, the smaller sized families are flagged for removal.
If `--skip_family_merging` is set to `false`, and if `hmmsearch_family_similarity_length_threshold` is correctly set
lower than `hmmsearch_family_redundancy_length_threshold` (or `skip_family_redundancy_removal` is set to `true`), then similar family seed alignments can be merged
and go through the `generate_families` subworkflow once more.
Most `remove_redundancy` outputs are optional folders that contain intermediate pipeline results, and therefore are not saved in the output results by default.

        - `<family_id>.faa`: (optional) FASTA files before gap removal from family MSAs. Can be turned on with `--save_update_families_pre_clipped_fasta`, when `skip_sequence_redundancy_removal` is false
    - `pre_clipped/`
      - `<samplename>/`
        - `<family_id>.faa`: (optional) FASTA files before gap removal from family MSAs. Can be turned on with `--save_update_families_pre_clipped_fasta`, but `skip_sequence_redundancy_removal` also needs to be true
    - `post_clipped/`
      - `<samplename>/`
        - `<family_id>.faa`: (optional) FASTA files with gaps removed from family MSAs. Can be turned on with `--save_update_families_clipped_fasta` (default: `true`)

</details>

The `seqkit` module is mainly used during the `update_families` mode
to extract sequences from family MSA, into intermediate fasta files (`seqkit` output folder).
The `update_families/fasta` folder contains optional FASTA outputs: `pre_clipped_non_redundant_sequences`, if sequence redundancy within families was removed, `pre_clipped` holds gap-removed sequences from aligned MSAs (before clipping, if sequence redundancy was not removed),
and `post_clipped` holds gappy-column-removed final sequences from clipped MSAs.

[SeqKit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit) is a cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file manipulation.

### MMseqs2 for updating families

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `mmseqs/`
  - `update_families/`
    - `mmseqs_createtsv/`
      - `<samplename>/`
        - `<family_id>.tsv`: tab-separated table containing 2 columns; the first one with the cluster representative sequences, and the second with the cluster members
    - `mmseqs_createdb/`
      - `<samplename>/`
        - `<family_id>/`
          - `*`: (optional) mmseqs format db of fasta sequences
    - `mmseqs_linclust/`

          - `*`: (optional) mmseqs format clustered db
    - `mmseqs_cluster/`
      - `<samplename>/`
        - `<family_id>/`
          - `*`: (optional) mmseqs format clustered db

</details>

Similarly to the in-family sequence redundancy removal mechanism, the mmseqs suite is used to strictly cluster
existing family sequences along newly recruited ones, keeping a non redundant set.

[MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) clusters amino acid fasta files via either the 'cluster' or the 'linclust' algorithms.

### FAMSA for updating families

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `update_families/`
  - `full_msa/`
    - `famsa_align/`
    - `<samplename>/`
      - `<family_id>.aln`: family full MSA (after updating with new sequences)

</details>

In the `update_families` mode, if new sequences are added in an existing family,
and after (optionally) removing in-family sequence redundacny, if `--skip_sequence_redundancy_removal` is set to `false`,
then the family MSA is recalculated.
If the `--alignment_tool` is `famsa`, then this `famsa_align` folder will be created, containing the updated family MSA files.

[FAMSA](https://github.com/refresh-bio/FAMSA) is a progressive algorithm for large-scale multiple sequence alignments.

### mafft for updating families

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `update_families/`
  - `full_msa/`
    - `mafft_align/`
    - `<samplename>/`
      - `<family_id>.fas`: family full MSA (after updating with new sequences)

</details>

In the `update_families` mode, if new sequences are added in an existing family,
and after (optionally) removing in-family sequence redundacny, if `--skip_sequence_redundancy_removal` is set to `false`,
then the family MSA is recalculated.
If the `--alignment_tool` is `mafft`, then this `mafft_align` folder will be created, containing the updated family MSA files.

[mafft](https://github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft) is a fast but not very sensitive multiple sequence alignment tool.

### ClipKIT for updating families

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `update_families/`
  - `full_msa/`
    - `clipkit/`
      - `<samplename>/`
        - `<family_id>.clipkit`: gap-clipped fasta files of aligned amino acid sequences

</details>

If the `--skip_msa_trimming` parameter was set to `false`, then `clipkit` runs, and according to the `--gap_threshold` parameter,
gaps (above that threshold, across all aligned sequences) are either removed only at the ends of the MSA if `trim_ends_only` is set to `true`, or throughout the alignment otherwise.
Results are stored in the `update_families/full_msa` folder.

[ClipKIT](https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/ClipKIT) is a fast and flexible alignment trimming tool that keeps phylogenetically informative sites and removes others.

### CMAPLE

      - `<family_name>.log`: a log file containing detailed information about the tree reconstruction process.

</details>

[CMAPLE](https://github.com/iqtree/cmaple) MAximum Parsimonious Likelihood Estimation in C/C++.

If the `--skip_phylogenetic_inference` is set to `false`, the full MSA treefiles will be calculated for the final protein families.
The generated treefiles can be visualized externally with any Newick phylogenetic tree viewer.

The `*_meta_mqc.csv` file are used to report family metadata and statistics in the browser, via the MultiQC software.
The `*_reps.faa` protein fasta file contains all family representative sequence in one place.
This file can be further used as input in other pipelines such as `nf-core/proteinfold` for structural prediction
or `nf-core/proteinannotator` for amino acid sequence annotation.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

Custom output MultiQC data includes a metadata file (`multiqc_data/multiqc_family_metadata.txt`) with family information such as: Sample,Family Id,Size,Representative Length,Representative Id,Sequence

This custom metadata is presented as a data table in the MultiQC report file.
