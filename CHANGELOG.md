## v1.1.0 - [yyyy/mm/dd]

### `Added`

- [#58](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/58) - Added nf-test and `meta.yml` file for local module `REMOVE_REDUNDANCY_SEQS` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#56](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/56) - Added nf-test and `meta.yml` file for local module `FILTER_RECRUITED` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#55](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/55) - Added nf-test and `meta.yml` file for local module `CHUNK_CLUSTERS` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#54](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/54) - Added nf-test for local subworkflow `ALIGN_SEQUENCES` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#53](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/53) - Added nf-test for local subworkflow `EXECUTE_CLUSTERING` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#51](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/51) - Added nf-test and `meta.yml` file for local module `CALCULATE_CLUSTER_DISTRIBUTION` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#34](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/34) - Added the `EXTRACT_UNIQUE_CLUSTER_REPS` module, that calculates initial `MMseqs` clustering metadata, for each sample, to print with `MultiQC` (Id,Cluster Size,Number of Clusters)

### `Fixed`

- [#35](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/35) - Fixed a bug in `remove_redundant_fams.py`, where comparison was between strings instead of integers to keep larger family
- [#33](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/33) - Fixed an always-true condition at the `filter_non_redundant_hmms.py` script, by adding missing parentheses
- [#29](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/29) - Fixed `hmmalign` empty input crash error, by preventing the `FILTER_RECRUITED` module from creating an empty output .fasta.gz file, when there are no remaining sequences after filtering the `hmmsearch` results [#28](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/issues/28)

### `Changed`

- [#57](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/57) - slight improvements of `nextflow_schema.json` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#57](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/57) - slight improtmenets of `assets/schema_input.json` (Hackathon 2025)
- [#34](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/34) - Swapped the `SeqIO` python library with `pyfastx` for the `CHUNK_CLUSTERS` module, quartering its duration
- [#32](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/32) - Updated `ClipKIT` 2.4.0 -> 2.4.1, that now also allows ends-only trimming, to completely replace the custom `CLIP_ENDS` module. Users can now also define its output format by setting the `--clipkit_out_format` parameter (default: `clipkit`)

### `Dependencies`

| Tool    | Previous version | New version |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| ClipKIT | 2.4.0            | 2.4.1       |
| pyfastx |                  | 2.2.0       |

### `Deprecated`

- [#32](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/32) - Deprecated `CLIP_ENDS` module and `--clipping_tool` parameter. The only option now is `ClipKIT`, covering both previous modes, via setting `--trim_ends_only`

## v1.0.0 - [2025/02/05]

Initial release of nf-core/proteinfamilies, created with the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) template

### `Added`

- Amino acid sequence clustering (mmseqs)
- Multiple sequence alignment (famsa, mafft, clipkit)
- Hidden Markov Model generation (hmmer)
- Between families redundancy removal (hmmer)
- In-family sequence redundancy removal (mmseqs)
- Family updating (hmmer, seqkit, mmseqs, famsa, mafft, clipkit)
- Family statistics presentation (multiqc)
