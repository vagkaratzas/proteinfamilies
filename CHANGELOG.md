and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v2.6.0dev - [unreleased]

### `Changed`

- [#189](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/189) - nf-core tools template update to 4.1.0. (by @vagkaratzas)

## v2.5.0 - [2026/08/11]

### `Added`

- [#182](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/182) - Added an alternative, iterative family generation algorithm, selectable with `--family_generation_algorithm iterative`. It hands whole chunks of clusters (`--clusters_per_chunk`) to `mgnifam`, which repeats HMM building, sequence recruitment and realignment per cluster until each family converges or is discarded. Applies to both newly created and merged families. (by @vagkaratzas)

### `Fixed`

- [#182](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/182) - Fixed `MERGE_FAMILIES:MERGE_SEEDS` using the first sample's seed MSAs for every sample: pooled families are now paired with their own sample's seeds. (by @vagkaratzas)
- [#177](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/177)
  - Fixed `OSError: [Errno 36] File name too long` in `MERGE_FAMILIES:MERGE_SEEDS` when a pool combines many families: `merged_id` now collapses to a stable hash once the readable form would exceed the filesystem name-length limit. (by @vagkaratzas, bug reported by @Yixuan39)
  - Fixed `FAMSA_ALIGN` aborting with exit status 134 on merged families: `MERGE_SEEDS` now drops all-gap records, which `CLIPKIT` can leave behind when a member's residues all fall in trimmed columns, and which FAMSA cannot realign. (by @vagkaratzas, bug reported by @Yixuan39)

### `Changed`

- [#186](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/186) - Raw family HMMs are now published under a subfolder named after the tool that built them, `hmm/raw/hmmer_hmmbuild/` or `hmm/raw/mgnifam/`, matching how the seed and full MSA outputs are already organised. (by @vagkaratzas, suggested by @nickp60)
- [#186](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/186) - Restricted samplesheet sample names to letters, digits, dots, underscores and dashes. Family names are parsed back out of file names with `split("<sample>_")`, which takes a regex, so a sample name carrying a regex metacharacter could mis-split; the sample name also builds output paths. (by @vagkaratzas, raised by @erikrikarddaniel)
- [#182](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/182) - Updated `CHUNK_CLUSTERS` and `MERGE_SEEDS` to optionally output `TSV`, required by the iterative family generation subworkflow. (by @vagkaratzas)
- [#179](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/179) - nf-core tools template update to 4.0.3. (by @vagkaratzas)

(by @vagkaratzas)
- [#118](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/118)
  - Swapped the local `CHECK_QUALITY` subworkflow with the new nf-core one `FAA_SEQFU_SEQKIT`. (by @vagkaratzas)
  - Based on protein family reproducibility benchmarks (i.e., computationally reproducing manually curated protein family resources), the `cluster_seq_identity` and `cluster_coverage` parameter default values have been updated to `0.3` and `0.5` (down from `0.5` and `0.9`) respectively. (by @vagkaratzas)
- [#117](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfamilies/pull/117) - Swapped the local `SEQKIT_STATS` and the local `SEQKIT_STATS_TO_MQC` modules with the `SEQFU_STATS` one, which runs a bit faster and produces a MultiQC-ready output without the need for manual parsing. (by @vagkaratzas)
