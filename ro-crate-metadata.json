Cluster sequences ([`MMseqs2`](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/))\n2. Perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) ([`FAMSA`](https://github.com/refresh-bio/FAMSA/) or [`mafft`](https://github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft/))\n3. Optionally, clip gap parts of the MSA ([`ClipKIT`](https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/ClipKIT/))\n4. Generate family HMMs and fish additional sequences into the family ([`hmmer`](https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer/))\n5. Optionally, remove redundant families by comparing family representative sequences against family models with ([`hmmer`](https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer/))\n6. Optionally, from the remaining families, remove in-family redundant sequences by strictly clustering with ([`MMseqs2`](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/)) and keep cluster representatives\n7. Present statistics for remaining/updated families size distributions and representative sequence lengths ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))\n\n### Update families\n\n1. Find which families to update by comparing the input sequences against existing family models with ([`hmmer`](https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer/))\n2. For non hit sequences continue with the above: A. Create families. For hit sequences and families continue to: 3\n3. Extract family sequences ([`SeqKit`](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit/)) and concatenate with filtered hit sequences of each family\n4. Optionally, remove in-family redundant sequences by strictly clustering with ([`MMseqs2`](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/)) and keeping cluster representatives\n5. Perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) ([`FAMSA`](https://github.com/refresh-bio/FAMSA/) or [`mafft`](https://github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft/))\n6. Optionally, clip gap parts of the MSA ([`ClipKIT`](https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/ClipKIT/))\n7. Update family HMM with ([`hmmer`](https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer/))\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\n\nFirst, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:\n\n`samplesheet.csv`:\n\n```csv\nsample,fasta,existing_hmms_to_update,existing_msas_to_update\nCONTROL_REP1,input/mgnifams_input_small.fa,,\n```\n\nEach row contains a fasta file with amino acid sequences (can be zipped or unzipped).\nOptionally, a row may contain tarball archives (tar.gz) of existing families' HMM and MSA folders, in order to be updated.\nIn this case, the HMM and MSA files must be matching in numbers and in base filenames (not the extension).\nHit families/sequences will be updated, while no hit sequences will create new families.\n\nNow, you can run the pipeline using:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/proteinfamilies \\\n   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\nFor more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/proteinfamilies/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/proteinfamilies/parameters).\n\n## Pipeline output\n\nTo see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/proteinfamilies/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.\nFor more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the\n[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/proteinfamilies/output).\n\n## Credits\n\nnf-core/proteinfamilies was originally written by Evangelos Karatzas.\n\nWe thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline:\n\n- [Martin Beracochea](https://github.com/mberacochea)\n\n## Contributions and Support\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please see the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFor further information or help, don't hesitate to get in touch on the [Slack `#proteinfamilies` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/proteinfamilies) (you can join with [this invite](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).\n\n## Citations\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add citation for pipeline after first release. Uncomment lines below and update Zenodo doi and badge at the top of this file. -->\n<!-- If you use nf-core/proteinfamilies for your analysis, please cite it using the following doi: [10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX) -->\n\nAn extensive list of references for the tools used by the pipeline can be found in the [`CITATIONS.md`](CITATIONS.md) file.\n\nYou can cite the `nf-core` publication as follows:\n\n> **The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines.**\n>\n> Philip Ewels, Alexander Peltzer, Sven Fillinger, Harshil Patel, Johannes Alneberg, Andreas Wilm, Maxime Ulysse Garcia, Paolo Di Tommaso & Sven Nahnsen.\n>\n> _Nat Biotechnol._ 2020 Feb 13. doi: [10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x).\n",
